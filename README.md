# Flask_api_alquiler
The objective of this project is to predict the rental price in Argentina, with 4 neighborhoods I predict the rest 44.
To do this, first I do a web .py scraping, with this I will build a model using different algorithms for example Xgboost / CatBoost / Logistic regression. Once the training is finished I select the best one. With this model I will program the connections to HTML with Flask. When everything is done, I put the solution into production with Heroku
