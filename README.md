# Flask_api_alquiler
This last example was done to show how simple it is to publish an API, how to scale solutions and combine different techniques:

1) Web scraping, it is a technique to massively and automatically collect data on the web.

2) I structured this data in order to use it to train the predictive model (XGBoost). 3) I created the API (XGBoost). 4) Then I built the API (XGBoost).

4) Then I built the API (I used Flask is a Python library) to connect the back with the front.

5) I built the HTML form.

6) With all this working I published it in Heroku so it can be accessed online.

 

The goal is: Training the model with 4 neighborhoods of CABA predict the "rental price" of the rest of the 44 neighborhoods, the independent variables are: *M2 *Bedrooms *Neighborhood.
